==== Next Steps ====
[ ] SIMD material evaluation (bucket hits by material)
[ ] Improved metrics collection & aggregation
[ ] Headless rendering mode (no Bevy, write to file)

==== Renderer ====
[ ] Multithreaded rendering (zero-copy writes per thread)
[ ] BVH with SIMD traversal
[ ] HDR environment maps
[ ] (Multiple) importance sampling
[ ] Photon mapping / SPPM
[ ] Adaptive sampling (early pixel convergence)
[ ] Denoising / filtering
[ ] Variance buffer or debug heatmaps
[ ] Wavefront path tracing on CPU
[ ] Wavefront path tracing on GPU
[ ] Reprojection

==== Scenes ====
[ ] Interactive camera and scene updates
[ ] Scene serialization / loading
[ ] Import triangle meshes (e.g. Stanford dragon)
